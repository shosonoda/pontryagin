# Fubini for kernels compactly supported in one variable, against a finite measure

This file fills a gap in Mathlib (general-purpose material with no project-specific content)
and is a candidate for upstreaming; see `UPSTREAMING.md` for the audit and target locations.

Mathlib's `integral_integral_swap_of_hasCompactSupport` swaps iterated integrals of jointly
continuous kernels that are compactly supported *in both variables*. This file extends the
swap to bounded jointly
continuous kernels `F : X → Y → E` that are compactly supported in only **one** variable (the
`y`-variable, say), integrated in the other variable against a **finite inner regular**
measure `σ`:

`∫ x, ∫ y, F x y ∂ν ∂σ = ∫ y, ∫ x, F x y ∂σ ∂ν`.

This is the form of Fubini needed for the symmetric-measure identity of Pontryagin duality:
there the kernel `(x, χ) ↦ f(x) χ(x) g(χ)` on `G × Ĝ` is compactly supported in `x` only,
but the character-space integration happens against finite (regular) measures.

As before there are **no product-measure or product-σ-algebra hypotheses**: the proof
truncates the kernel by Urysohn cutoffs `φ n` equal to `1` on an increasing sequence of
compact sets that exhausts `σ` (inner regularity), applies the compactly supported swap
to each truncation `φ n x • F x y`, and passes to the limit on both
sides by dominated convergence.

## Main statements

* `integral_integral_swap_of_finite_of_compactSupport`: the iterated-integral swap for a
  bounded continuous kernel vanishing for `y` outside a compact set, with `σ` a finite
  measure on `X` that is inner regular on finite-measure sets.
* `continuous_integral_right_of_forall_compl_eq_zero`,
  `continuous_integral_left_of_forall_compl_eq_zero`: the partial integral of a jointly
  continuous kernel compactly supported in the *integrated* variable only is continuous
  in the remaining variable.

## Implementation notes

The inner-regularity hypothesis is stated as `σ.InnerRegularCompactLTTop` (inner regularity
on measurable sets of finite measure with respect to compact sets), which is weaker than
`σ.InnerRegular`; the instance `[σ.InnerRegular] → σ.InnerRegularCompactLTTop` makes the
theorem directly applicable to inner regular measures. The hypotheses `[T2Space X]`,
`[LocallyCompactSpace X]` provide the Urysohn cutoffs (`RegularSpace X` is automatic there),
and `[R1Space Y]` ensures `closure K` is compact, so that the truncated kernels are honestly
compactly supported on `X × Y`. All hypotheses hold in the intended applications, where `X`
and `Y` are locally compact Hausdorff groups and `σ` is a finite Radon-type measure.

/-! ### The iterated-integral swap -/

/-- **Fubini for bounded continuous kernels compactly supported in one variable, against a
finite inner regular measure.** Let `F : X → Y → E` be a bounded jointly continuous kernel
vanishing for `y` outside a compact set `K`. If `σ` is a finite measure on `X` that is inner
regular (for finite-measure sets, with respect to compact sets) and `ν` is finite on compact
sets, then the iterated integrals agree:

`∫ x, ∫ y, F x y ∂ν ∂σ = ∫ y, ∫ x, F x y ∂σ ∂ν`.

There are **no** product-measure, product-σ-algebra, s-finiteness or second-countability
hypotheses; compact support in the `x`-variable is replaced by finiteness and inner
regularity of `σ`. -/
