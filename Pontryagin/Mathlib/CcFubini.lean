# Fubini for jointly continuous compactly supported kernels

This file fills a gap in Mathlib (general-purpose material with no project-specific content)
and is a candidate for upstreaming; see `UPSTREAMING.md` for the audit and target locations.

The measure-theoretic workhorse of the project: for a jointly continuous, compactly supported
kernel `F : X → Y → E` on topological spaces equipped with Borel-compatible measures that are
finite on compact sets, the two iterated Bochner integrals agree:

`∫ x, ∫ y, F x y ∂ν ∂μ = ∫ y, ∫ x, F x y ∂μ ∂ν`.

Crucially, there are **no product-measure, product-σ-algebra, (s/σ-)finiteness, regularity or
second-countability hypotheses**: on a general locally compact abelian group (e.g. the
Pontryagin dual of a compact group, which can fail to be σ-compact), Haar measure is not
s-finite and the usual Fubini theorems do not apply. The swap itself is
Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.integral_integral_swap_of_hasCompactSupport` (used directly
downstream); this file provides the slice lemmas that make iterated integrals of
such kernels usable downstream (convolution of `C_c` functions, approximate identities, the
symmetric measure identity):

* slices `F x` and `fun x ↦ F x y` are continuous, compactly supported, hence integrable;
* the partial integrals `fun x ↦ ∫ y, F x y ∂ν` and `fun y ↦ ∫ x, F x y ∂μ` are continuous
  and compactly supported, hence integrable;
* a sup-norm × measure bound for the iterated integral.

## Main statements

* `HasCompactSupport.uncurry_left`, `HasCompactSupport.uncurry_right`: compact support of
  slices.
* `Continuous.integrable_uncurry_left`, `Continuous.integrable_uncurry_right`: integrability
  of slices.
* `continuous_integral_right`, `hasCompactSupport_integral_right`, `integrable_integral_right`
  (and the `_left` counterparts): the partial integrals are continuous, compactly supported,
  integrable.
* `norm_integral_integral_le_of_support_subset`:
  `‖∫ x, ∫ y, F x y ∂ν ∂μ‖ ≤ C * μ.real K₁ * ν.real K₂` for a kernel bounded by `C` and
  supported in `K₁ ×ˢ K₂`.

Everything is stated typeclass-minimally: `OpensMeasurableSpace` plus
`IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts` suffice for all integrability statements (no `BorelSpace`, no
regularity), and `R1Space` (weaker than `T2Space`) is all that is needed where supports must
be closed off compact sets. In particular all hypotheses hold for Haar measure on a locally
compact Hausdorff group and, more generally, for any Radon-type measure on a locally compact
Hausdorff space.

A nonnegative real-valued version of the swap needs no separate statement: it is the special
case `E = ℝ` (or follows from `E = ℂ` by taking real parts).
