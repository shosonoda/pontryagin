# The spectrum of `L¹(G)` elements through the unitization

This file transfers the character classification of `Pontryagin.Spectrum` to the unital
commutative Banach algebra `WithLp 1 (Unitization ℂ (L1G μ))` (the unitization of the
convolution algebra with the `L¹` product norm), and extracts the spectral-radius facts
in the exact shape consumed by the Bochner layer.

## Main definitions

* `L1G.unitizationInrCLM μ : L1G μ →L[ℂ] WithLp 1 (Unitization ℂ (L1G μ))`: the isometric
  inclusion, as a continuous linear map;
* `L1G.npow μ F n`: the convolution power `F^(n+1)` (the non-unital algebra `L1G μ` has no
  `Monoid` structure, hence no `^`).

## Main results

* `L1G.spectrum_unitization_subset`: the spectrum of `F` in the unitization is contained in
  `{0} ∪ range (𝓕F)` — every unital character either kills `L¹(G)` (the augmentation) or
  restricts to a character of `L¹(G)`, which is evaluation of the Fourier transform by
  `L1G.characterSpace_exists_char`;
* `L1G.spectralRadius_unitization_le`: a uniform bound `‖𝓕F‖_∞ ≤ C` bounds the spectral
  radius by `C`;
* `L1G.exists_norm_npow_rpow_le`: the Gelfand-formula consequence
  `‖F^(n+1)‖^(1/(n+1)) ≤ C + ε` for `n` large, ready for the Cauchy–Schwarz iteration of
  the Bochner layer.
